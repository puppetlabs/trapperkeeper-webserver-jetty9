  1) URL (percent) decode the path, assuming any percent-encodings represent
     UTF-8 characters.

   An exception may be thrown if the request has malformed content, e.g.,
   partially-formed percent-encoded characters like '%A%B'.

   If a semicolon character, U+003B, is found during the decoding process, it
   and any following characters will be removed from the decoded path.

  2) Check the percent-decoded path for any relative path segments ('..' or
     '.').

   An IllegalArgumentException is thrown if one or more segments are found.

  3) Compact any repeated forward slash characters in a path."
